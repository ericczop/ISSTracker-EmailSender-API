# ISS Tracker
Program checks whether the International Space Station (ISS) is overhead and if it is nighttime at a specific location.
If true, it sends an email alert notifying the user to look up. The script utilizes APIs for ISS location and sunrise-sunset data, running indefinitely with a 60-second interval.
